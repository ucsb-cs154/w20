# ucsb-cs-course-repos/boilerplate

The support files that should be in every course repo

See: <https://ucsb-cs-course-repos.github.io/topics/setup_boilerplate/>

When the ruby version needs to change, this repo is where you change it.

For example on the day I added  this comment:
* the version in the boilerplates files was 2.5.1,
* but tgithub pages has already moved to 2.5.3

You can see the current version at <https://pages.github.com/versions/>)
